## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key

### Automated Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praveenkumaroleti/voice-clone-bot.git
   cd voice-clone-app
   ```

2. Run the installation script
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Configure your OpenAI API key
   - Open `server/.env` file
   - Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key

4. Start the application

   **Start the server**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```

   **In a separate terminal, start the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd voice-clone-app
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Manual Installation

If the automated installation script doesn't work for you, follow these steps:

1. Install frontend dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a frontend `.env` file (optional)
   ```bash
   echo "REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3001" > .env
   ```

3. Install backend dependencies
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a server `.env` file
   ```bash
   echo "PORT=3001" > .env
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" >> .env
   ```

5. Start both servers as described in the Automated Installation section

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Voice Input**: The app uses the Web Speech API to convert your speech to text
2. **AI Processing**: Your question is sent to the backend, which uses OpenAI's API to generate a response
3. **Voice Output**: The response is converted back to speech using the Web Speech API
4. **Profile Information**: The app displays Praveen's profile information in an organized, tabbed interface
